Always make a plan first, before ever coding anything. The plan is the most important part when starting.

Breaking down the starting todo list ---

TODO

[] collect salary data
    [x] form
        [x]html input fields
        [x]submit button
        []click listener
            [] add function
            [] clear input fields
            []collect employee
                []add to array
[]employee data
    [] table - same headings as inputs
        [] delete button
        [] headers and footers

[] total monthly cost calculation
    [] show monthly total
    [] turn red if over $20k

[] delete employee
    [] delete button for each employee
        [] click listener
            [] removes employee from DOM
            []recalc monthly - subtract their salary

PROJECT SETUP
